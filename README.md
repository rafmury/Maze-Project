- Nim character animation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- OpenGL and GLUT development libraries

### Building

Use a C compiler to build the executable:

```bash
gcc maze_game.c -o maze_game -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm
```

### Running

Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./maze_game
```

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the player in the maze.
- **Space Bar**: Toggle the enemy movement.
- **1-5 keys**: Toggle different lighting and visual effects.
- **C key**: Change the maze size.
- **V key**: Toggle between different viewing modes.

## Gameplay

Navigate through the maze, reach the entrance and exit doors, and enjoy the visual effects and animations. Adjust lighting and viewing modes for a different gaming experience.
